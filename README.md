# docs.kerrishaus.com
This is unnamed custom wiki software for docs.kerrishaus.com.  

This project exists because MediaWiki did not support PHP 8.1 at the time.

Content for the mainline site can be found on the [docs.kerrishaus.com-content](https://github.com/kerrishaus/docs.kerrishaus.com-content).

# How to use

I would not use this over MediaWiki unless you desire to be deeply unhappy.

## Server Requirements
- PHP 8.1

## Installation

Just clone the project files onto a lamp server and edit the configuration section to suit your needs.
