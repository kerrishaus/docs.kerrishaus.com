notice the only buttons which lead to direct actions are to create new transactions, these are called quick actions and they are the single most important part of the financial management system, because they are how you create a transaction. because my system is not able to monitor bank accounts and automatically add transactions, users have to add transactions manually. because of this, the most common thing people will do when visiting this page is add a transaction. to that end, quick links must be the most important and fastest thing to access within this page. thus, they are placed at the top on both mobile and desktop. they visually stand out from other elements on the page and they function differently from other elements on the page. other links on the page will direct the user to more direct methods of interacting with their finances. there are no other direct controls here because introducing controls for each function and page referenced would clutter the page too much and draw the eyes away from the quick links at the top of the page. other direct function elements would further distract from the unity of the page, as there would be multiple areas with multiple meanings which means any user would have to have multiple contexts of usage in their minds for each area they are looking at. most often this frustrates users and results in extra features being overlooked and not used. by making each page clear and distinct in what it does and moving into other featuers and pages it gives the user a much more clear and distinct idea of what is happening on any given page, and gives them a clear visual flow of functionality as they traverse a given page to another give page
